Currently known problems and limitations
========================================

Here are some current problems and limitations of Expyriment you should be 
aware of. Where possible, we include suggestions on how to deal with or work 
around the issue.

MPEG-1 video playback only
--------------------------
At the moment, only MPEG-1 video files can be played back.

This is a limitation of the underlying video system of Pygame. On the long run, 
we are planning to move to a different Python video package.

No native 3D stimuli
--------------------
Right now Expyriment only offers static 2D visual stimuli.

While PyOpenGL can be used direclty to create dynamic 3D stimuli, we are 
planning to add a dedicated 3D stimulus class in the future, to facilitate the 
creation of 3D stimuli.
